      I enjoy working in a variety of domains, which is why I am drawn to full-stack development. I get much enjoyment out of creating functional things for other people to use. My dream role would be on a small team of passionate individuals who care about doing excellent work, at a small to medium size organization.

      I view LLMs as collaborative partners that complement my hands-on learning style. These tools help me rapidly prototype ideas and discover cutting-edge design patterns, yet I always anchor their output in fundamental understanding. This balance allows me to embrace AI's exploratory potential while preserving the human intention behind every technical decision.

      In my creative practice, I explore community play, aiming to create spaces for unexpected outcomes in digital environments. Rather than producing an artifact, my work investigates how to bring about a generative space - constructing a more permeable border between artist and audience.

      On weekends, I work on an organic farm (where I also assist with graphic design and website maintenance). I enjoy seeing live music in Boston from around the world and eating a full Turkish breakfast.
